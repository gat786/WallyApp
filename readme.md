This is a fun app that i always wanted to make. It was something that i always
thought of and maybe it sounds silly but it was one of small wishes to make 
this. 

I chose the UWP Platform to make it because it looks pretty by default and
requires knowledge about things that i already know or have a basic idea about.

The working of this app is simple and sets a beautiful picture as your pcs
wallpaper. I have demonstrated the work as following.

Here are some future goals and features that i want this app to have.

1. SubReddit's Images Handlers [earthporn,wallpaper etc]
2. Nasa's POTD included
3. Unsplash's Handlers

I intend to keep it ad free and open source so any additions to the project are freely accepted.
